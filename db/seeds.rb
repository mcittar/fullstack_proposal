  description: 'From the original factory. The Hawaii Chair brings you passive exercise while sitting indoors. The Hawaii Chair was designed to give movement back to the bodyâ€™s center of mass, no matter how restrictive your lifestyle! Great if you are desk-bound for too-long hours. Great for women. Great for those with leg or foot problems, or having difficulty to exercise easily. The strong circular motion of the hips and abdomen gives intestines and stomach a rhythmic massage, for a stimulated and active feeling even while you remain sitting. Use it to enhance your program of weight reduction. Gentle massage of the lower back can ease minor aches, pains and stiffness. Steady motion with awareness can improve your balance and coordination as it gently works on your lumbar region.',
